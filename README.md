# PAAGH VEST

The goal of the project was to create a device that can be a every sailor guardian angel. The vest detects moment when user falls overboard and starts monitoring vitals and broadcasting SOS signal over AIS protocool. 

A group assignment where the personal contribution lies in the pulse sensor running on the software part of the project (App -> Src -> pv_pulse.c)
